## Overview 

SARS-CoV-2 has evolved variants with substitutions in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that impact its affinity for ACE2 receptor and recognition by antibodies. These substitutions could also shape future evolution by modulating the effects of mutations at other sitesâ€”a phenomenon called epistasis. To investigate this possibility, we performed deep mutational scans to measure the impact on ACE2 binding of all single amino-acid mutations in the Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Eta variant RBDs.

Here, we link to two interactive visualizations that enable exploration of the data from these deep mutational scans across SARS_CoV-2 variants. The manuscript detailing the results of these experiments is published [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.24.481899v1). 

### Instructions 

We have made two tools to help visualize the data from our deep mutational scans:

1. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore the change in ACE2-binding affinity ($$\Delta$$log10 $$K_D$$) or the change in RBD expression (log10(MFI)) caused by mutations in each RBD variant. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps.md %}).

2. An interactive widget that you can use to visualize epistatic shifts in mutational effects on ACE2-binding affinity (-log10 $$K_D$$) between variant RBDs. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link epistasis.md %}).  

### Data

If you are interested in the raw data from our study, you can find the ACE2-binding affinity (-log10 $$K_D$$) and RBD expression (log10(MFI)) measurements from each experiment [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS_variants/blob/main/results/final_variant_scores/final_variant_scores.csv). You can find the data used to plot the epistatic shifts between variant backgrounds [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS_variants/blob/main/results/epistatic_shifts/JSD_versus_Wuhan1_by_target.csv).
