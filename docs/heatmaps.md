## Overview

You can use this tool to explore site and amino acid level measurements in both the change in ACE2 binding affinity (log10 Kd) and the change in RBD expression relative to a wildtype amino acid. 

### Instruction

To use this tool, select the DMS library that you wish to display in each plot by selecting a variant from the drop down menu corresponding to each plot. Then, you can select the metric that you wish to display in the heatmap (either change in ACE2 binding affinity, or change in RBD expression) by selecting that metric in the corresponding drop down menu. 

### Technical Details

The impact on ACE2 receptor-binding affinity (delta log10(KD)) or RBD expression of every single amino-acid mutation in SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, as determined by high-throughput titration assays. Wildtype amino acids are indicated by an 'x', and gray squares indicate missing mutations from each library.
